## Usage (Practical)
**General Usage:** This project can be used for any needs for automating adding songs and artists from any spotify playlist to Google Sheets for any response/discussion need such as being used in a classroom to record student responses to educational podcasts or book clubs to automate members rating audiobooks.

**Specific Usage:** I use this project to automate adding songs to Google Sheets for my band's communications about potential songs to add to our performing set list. We add potential songs to our shared Spotify playlist for the rest of us to listen to. To keep a record of our thoughts, I integrated Google Sheets so that we could rate each of the songs on our Spotify Playlist in various categories and give our feedback (Overall rating, Playability, Comments). This data is then used in an overall calculation, which determines which songs to add to our playlist based on specified thresholds.
